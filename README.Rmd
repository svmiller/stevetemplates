`stevetemplates` is an R package to help you create lovely R Markdown documents, primarily for conversion to LaTeX PDFs. They come from [my suite of R Markdown templates](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates), which I'm making available as an R package. The impetus behind the R package is three-fold. First, I've always wanted to get something on CRAN just to say I did it. Two, I'm hopelessly vain and like making my first name as a prefix for various R-related things (see also: [`stevemisc`](https://github.com/svmiller/stevemisc) and the forthcoming `stevedata` as part of the hypothetical and ideally also forthcoming `steveverse` for all things R and me (i.e. Steve)). Three, it would be nice to cut down on how clunky my YAML can get and it'd be nice for me and other users to have one single place to store these templates that don't depend on my cornball relative paths.

## Installation

You can install this on CRAN.

```r
install.packages("stevetemplates")
```

The development version may also have some extra goodies not yet published on CRAN. You can install the development version of `stevetemplates` from Github via the `devtools` package. I suppose using the `remotes` package would work as well.

```r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/stevetemplates")
```

## Usage

The easiest way to use my templates is within Rstudio. Go to *File > New File > R Markdown*. Here, select any template you'd like to use. The version on CRAN should lag behind the development version, but the development version includes the following templates:

- **Steve's Anonymous Manuscript Template**: This is an R Markdown template I used exactly once for an anonymous manuscript submission that needed to look an exact way. That submission was not published at that journal. I have not had the occasion to submit there again.
- [**Steve's First Article/Manuscript Template**](http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/02/svm-r-markdown-manuscript/): This is my first article/manuscript template and I made it around 2016. I include this as a legacy. I used to use these quite often for my manuscripts, though I switched to another template (also included in this package). I don't intend to offer much support for this template anymore, but it has lots of goodies (e.g. appendix support, suppressing title pages, etc.). You can call it in the YAML with `stevetemplates::article`.
- [**Steve's 2nd Article/Manuscript Template**](http://svmiller.com/blog/2020/09/another-rmarkdown-article-template/): This is my second article/manuscript template that I made in September 2020. It's patterned off [the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) LaTeX templates](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/acm-publications). You can call it in the YAML with `stevetemplates::article2`.
- [**Steve's Academic CV Template**](http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/03/svm-r-markdown-cv/): This is my academic CV template I made in 2016, and I think it's my most popular. It's certainly the one I see most often in the wild. It's also what I currently use for [my CV](http://svmiller.com/cv/). You can call it in the YAML with `stevetemplates::cv`.
- [**Steve's Non-Academic Résumé Template**](http://svmiller.com/blog/2020/09/rmarkdown-template-non-academic-resume/): This is an addition I made in 2020 to my suite of R Markdown templates. It's a bit clunky, but it's useful and markup-light for non-academic résumés. You can call it in the YAML with `stevetemplates::resume`.
- **Steve's HTML Template**: I created this template on the fly for formatting academic manuscripts to an HTML document. Capabilities are limited the extent to which there's more CSS I need to adjust. This manuscript features prominently in my [`{steveproj}`](https://github.com/svmiller/steveproj) package.
- [**Steve's Memo Template**](http://svmiller.com/blog/2019/06/r-markdown-memo-template/): I created this for a memo I needed to write in 2019. You can call it in the YAML with `stevetemplates::memo`.
- **Steve's Statement Template**: I created this template in 2016 (I believe). I use it for writing various "statements" (e.g. [my research statement](http://svmiller.com/docs/svm-research-statement.pdf), statement of [teaching philosophy](http://svmiller.com/docs/svm-teaching-philosophy.pdf)) when applying for jobs. I also use it for miscellaneous university busy work. You can call it in the YAML with `stevetemplates::statement`.
- **Steve's Word Template**: I created this template many years ago and never worked with it because Word is limited in its functionality. I've since come back to this template because its limitations make it wonderful for "anonymizing" a manuscript for submission to journals that are picky about PDF submissions. This manuscript features prominently in my [`{steveproj}`](https://github.com/svmiller/steveproj) package.

The user should notice that the YAML contains the functions (loaded in this package) to compile these documents. They are basic wrappers for `rmarkdown::pdf_document`. Please consult the corresponding posts and [the template repository](https://github.com/svmiller/stevetemplates/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates) for rudimentary examples and the underlying code to help guide your usage.
